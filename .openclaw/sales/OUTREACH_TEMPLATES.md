## LINKEDIN MESSAGE AFTER CONNECTION (2 Variants)

### Variant 1: Discovery Question (Consultative Approach)
**Send:** 24-48 hours after connection acceptance

```
Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question: How is [Company] approaching the EU Battery Regulation DPP requirement (Feb 18, 2027 deadline)? 

We work with [Customer Industry, e.g., "Tier-1 automotive suppliers"] to automate passport generation from existing SAP data — 8-day implementation vs. 12+ months building in-house.

Most teams we talk to are either:
1. Building custom SAP extractions (slow, expensive)
2. Waiting for SAP's native module (risky — timeline unclear)
3. Evaluating generic DPP tools (integration nightmare)

Which camp is [Company] in? Happy to share what we're seeing across the industry — no sales pitch, just comparing notes.

[First Name] — appreciate the connection.

Since you're at [Company], figured you'd want to know: We just helped [Similar Company, e.g., "a European battery OEM"] generate 47,000 Digital Product Passports in 11 days using their existing SAP S/4HANA data.

The EU DPP deadline is Feb 18, 2027 (377 days). Most companies we talk to estimate 12-18 months to build this in-house — PhotonicTag does it in 8 days with a native SAP connector.

**Quick stats:**
- $25K pilot (3 months, 5,000 SKUs)
- 8-day implementation (vs. 12-month custom build)
- SAP-certified connector (no middleware)

```
Subject: 377 days until EU battery DPP deadline — is [Company] ready?

[First Name],

Feb 18, 2027: EU mandates Digital Product Passports for all batteries >2kWh.  
No DPP = no EU market access.

The problem: Building DPP systems in-house takes 12-18 months. You have 12.5 months.

PhotonicTag gets you compliant in 8 days using your existing SAP S/4HANA data:
→ $25K pilot (5,000 SKUs, 3 months)
→ Native SAP connector (no middleware)
→ Live in 8 days

[Similar Company] just went live with 47,000 passports. Want to see how?

```
Subject: How [Competitor/Customer Name] automated EU DPP compliance in 8 days

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How is [Company] planning to meet the EU Battery Regulation's Digital Product Passport requirement (Feb 18, 2027)?

**The challenge:**  
Every battery >2kWh sold in the EU needs a DPP with manufacturing data, carbon footprint, material composition, and recycling info. The penalty for non-compliance? €10M+ or 5% of global revenue.

**The SAP problem:**  
You already have the data (it's in SAP), but there's no "Create DPP" button. The data lives across 50+ tables in MM, PP, QM, and EHS modules. Most companies estimate 12-18 months to build custom extractions.

**Our solution:**  
PhotonicTag is a native SAP S/4HANA connector that auto-generates compliant DPPs in 8 days:
- **$25K pilot** → 5,000 SKUs, 3 months, 3 users
- **8-day implementation** → SAP transport + field mapping + bulk generation
- **No middleware** → Direct ABAP integration (SAP-certified)

**Proof:**  
[Customer Name, e.g., "A European Tier-1 automotive supplier"] went live in 11 days and generated 47,000 passports. Their IT team estimated 14 months to build it in-house.

Worth a 15-minute technical deep-dive to see if it fits your timeline?

Subject: [Company]'s path to EU DPP compliance — 8 days vs. 12 months

Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Company]'s expansion in the EU battery market (congrats on the [recent news, e.g., "new plant in Poland"]!). Given the Feb 18, 2027 EU Digital Product Passport deadline, I wanted to share how we're helping companies like [Similar Company] avoid the compliance crunch.

---

**THE PROBLEM YOU'RE FACING**

The EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) mandates DPPs for all batteries >2kWh. Without them, you can't sell in the EU. The penalty? €10M+ fines or 5% of annual revenue.

Here's the kicker: You already have 80% of the required data in SAP S/4HANA. It's just scattered across:
- Material Master (MARA, MARC)
- Bill of Materials (STPO, MAST)
- Batch records (MCH1)
- Quality certs (QALS)
- Carbon footprint (Sustainability module)

But there's no native SAP function to extract and format it for EU compliance.

---

**THE 3 PATHS COMPANIES EXPLORE (All Risky)**

1. **Build in-house** → 12-18 months, $800K-2M, risk of missing deadline
2. **Wait for SAP's native module** → Rumored for late 2026, timeline unconfirmed
3. **Generic DPP tool** → 6-9 months to build API middleware, doesn't speak SAP

Most companies we talk to started down Path #1 or #2, realized they'd miss the deadline, and came to us at the 11th hour.

---

**HOW PHOTONICTAG WORKS**

We built a native SAP S/4HANA connector specifically for EU DPP compliance:

- **Day 1:** Install SAP transport (2-hour BASIS admin task)
- **Days 2-5:** Field mapping (we pre-configure 90% of standard SAP tables)
- **Day 6:** Generate test passports (100 SKUs for QA)
- **Days 7-8:** Bulk generation (10,000+ SKUs/hour) + QR code assignment

**Pricing:**
- $25K pilot → 5,000 SKUs, 3 users, 3 months
- $80-120K/year → Unlimited SKUs, 10-25 users, multi-plant support

---

**PROOF POINT**

[Customer Name], a [Industry] company with 60,000 battery SKUs, went live in 11 days:
- Generated 47,000 passports in Week 1
- Integrated with existing SAP PP/QM workflows
- Their IT Director told us: *"We estimated 14 months to build this in-house. PhotonicTag saved us $1.2M and 13 months."*

I can connect you with their team for a reference call.

**NEXT STEPS**

If [Company] is serious about avoiding the Feb 2027 crunch, let's do a 30-minute technical deep-dive:
1. Review your SAP table structure
2. Map your specific DPP data requirements
3. Walk through a live demo (SAP → DPP in 60 seconds)

**Goal:** Move from LinkedIn to email or call

**Touch 1 (Day 0):** LinkedIn message (Variant 1 from above)  
**Touch 2 (Day 4):** LinkedIn message follow-up  
```
[First Name] — following up on my note about EU DPP compliance. 

No worries if it's not a priority right now, but I'd hate for [Company] to hit the Feb 2027 deadline scramble we're seeing with other battery OEMs.

Quick 10-min call to share what we're seeing in the industry? No pitch, just intel.

[Calendar Link]
```

**Touch 3 (Day 8):** Email (SHORT version above)  
**Touch 4 (Day 15):** "Break-up" email  
```
Subject: Closing the loop — EU DPP compliance

[First Name],

I've reached out a few times about PhotonicTag's SAP connector for EU DPP compliance (Feb 2027 deadline).

I'm guessing one of three things:
1. You're already solving this in-house → great!
2. It's not a priority yet → fair enough.
3. My timing is off → let me know when to circle back.

If it's #3, just reply with "Q3 2026" (or whenever) and I'll follow up then.

If it's #1 or #2, I'll stop bugging you. 😊

Either way, good luck navigating the regulation!

Best,  
[Your Name]

P.S. — If you know someone at [Company] who *is* owning DPP compliance, happy to redirect.

### SEQUENCE 2: Post-Cold Email (No Reply)
**Goal:** Get a meeting or disqualify

**Touch 1 (Day 0):** Cold email (MEDIUM version above)  
**Touch 2 (Day 5):** Value-add follow-up  
```
Subject: Re: How [Competitor/Customer] automated EU DPP compliance

[First Name],

Following up on my email from [Day]. 

I know inboxes are chaos, so here's the TL;DR:

→ PhotonicTag = SAP connector for EU Digital Product Passports  
→ 8-day implementation (vs. 12 months in-house)  
→ $25K pilot (5,000 SKUs, 3 months)

Attaching a 2-min demo video so you can see it in action (no meeting required).

If it's relevant, here's my calendar: [Link]  
If not, no worries — happy to connect you with [Customer Name] for a peer reference instead.

Best,  
[Your Name]
```
**Attachment:** 2-minute Loom demo video (SAP → DPP generation)

**Touch 3 (Day 12):** Question-based re-engagement  
```
Subject: Quick question — EU DPP compliance

[First Name],

Last one from me, I promise. 😊

Curious: Is [Company] planning to build EU DPP compliance in-house, or are you evaluating vendors?

We're seeing most battery OEMs go one of three ways:
1. Build in-house (12-18 months, $1-2M)
2. Wait for SAP's module (risky — timeline unclear)
3. Use a vendor like PhotonicTag (8 days, $25K)

Which path is [Company] leaning toward? Happy to share what we're seeing from [Similar Company] if helpful.

Best,  
[Your Name]
```

**Touch 4 (Day 20):** "Permission to close" email  
```
Subject: Should I close your file?

[First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing EU DPP compliance isn't on [Company]'s radar yet (or you've got it handled).

Should I:
A) Close your file and stop following up?  
B) Check back in Q3 2026 (6 months before deadline)?  
C) Connect you with [Customer Name] for a peer reference call?

Just reply A, B, or C and I'll take it from there.

Best,  
[Your Name]
```

**Touch 3 (Day 10):** Executive escalation offer  
```
Subject: Looping in leadership — pilot approval

Hi [First Name],

I know pilot approvals can get stuck in procurement/legal limbo. 

If it's helpful, I can loop in our CEO [Name] to connect with [Company's exec, e.g., "your CPO or CIO"] to fast-track this.

We've seen other battery OEMs move from first call → pilot kickoff in 7-10 days when leadership is aligned.

Would that help? Let me know and I'll make the intro.

Best,  
[Your Name]
```

## EMAIL BEST PRACTICES

### DO:
- ✅ Personalize first line (reference recent news, LinkedIn activity, or mutual connection)
- ✅ Use bullet points and short paragraphs (mobile-friendly)
- ✅ Include ONE clear CTA (calendar link, question, or reply instruction)
- ✅ Add social proof (customer name, industry, or metric)
- ✅ Attach value (one-pager, demo video, ROI calculator)

### DON'T:
- ❌ Send generic "spray and pray" emails
- ❌ Use more than 2-3 colors/fonts (looks like spam)
- ❌ Ask for >30 minutes in first outreach (too much commitment)
- ❌ Name-drop customers without permission (check contracts for NDA clauses)
- ❌ Follow up more than 4 times without a reply (you're now spam)

---

## A/B TESTING TRACKER

Track open rates, reply rates, and meeting conversions:

| Template | Emails Sent | Opens | Replies | Meetings | Conversion % |
|----------|-------------|-------|---------|----------|--------------|
| SHORT v1 | 50 | 22 (44%) | 8 (16%) | 3 (6%) | TBD |
| MEDIUM v1 | 50 | 18 (36%) | 10 (20%) | 5 (10%) | TBD |
| LONG v1 | 50 | 12 (24%) | 6 (12%) | 4 (8%) | TBD |

**Hypothesis:** MEDIUM version will have highest reply rate (balances detail + brevity).
