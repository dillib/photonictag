NEED HELP?

Common Questions:

Q: Can I edit these files after uploading to Google Drive?
A: Yes! Once converted to Google Sheets/Docs/Slides, you can edit them freely.

   • The Google Slides deck (present during meetings)
   • Individual email/LinkedIn messages (sent one-to-one)
   Never share the full target accounts list or all templates.

A: In the target accounts spreadsheet, add a "Template Used" column and track reply rates.
   Example: "LinkedIn Variant 1" or "Email Short Version"

A: Absolutely! These are starting points. Personalize based on:
   • Your prospect's industry
   • Recent company news
   • Your own writing style
   • What's working in your outreach

Q: How often should I update the target accounts spreadsheet?
A: Update it daily as you make progress:
   • Status changes (Contacted → Replied → Meeting → Pilot)
   • Last contact date
   • Next follow-up date
   • Notes from calls/emails
