SECTION 2: LINKEDIN FOLLOW-UP MESSAGES (AFTER CONNECTION)
====================================================================================================

--- MESSAGE 1: DISCOVERY QUESTION (CONSULTATIVE) ---
Send: 24-48 hours after connection acceptance

Thanks for connecting, [First Name]!

Quick question: How is [Company] approaching the EU Battery Regulation DPP requirement (Feb 18, 2027 deadline)? 

We work with [Customer Industry, e.g., "Tier-1 automotive suppliers"] to automate passport generation from existing SAP data — 8-day implementation vs. 12+ months building in-house.

Most teams we talk to are either:
1. Building custom SAP extractions (slow, expensive)
2. Waiting for SAP's native module (risky — timeline unclear)
3. Evaluating generic DPP tools (integration nightmare)

Which camp is [Company] in? Happy to share what we're seeing across the industry — no sales pitch, just comparing notes.

--- MESSAGE 2: VALUE PROP + CASE STUDY (DIRECT) ---
Send: 24-48 hours after connection acceptance

[First Name] — appreciate the connection.

Since you're at [Company], figured you'd want to know: We just helped [Similar Company, e.g., "a European battery OEM"] generate 47,000 Digital Product Passports in 11 days using their existing SAP S/4HANA data.

The EU DPP deadline is Feb 18, 2027 (377 days). Most companies we talk to estimate 12-18 months to build this in-house — PhotonicTag does it in 8 days with a native SAP connector.

Quick stats:
• $25K pilot (3 months, 5,000 SKUs)
• 8-day implementation (vs. 12-month custom build)
• SAP-certified connector (no middleware)

Subject: 377 days until EU battery DPP deadline — is [Company] ready?

[First Name],

Feb 18, 2027: EU mandates Digital Product Passports for all batteries >2kWh.  
No DPP = no EU market access.

The problem: Building DPP systems in-house takes 12-18 months. You have 12.5 months.

PhotonicTag gets you compliant in 8 days using your existing SAP S/4HANA data:
→ $25K pilot (5,000 SKUs, 3 months)
→ Native SAP connector (no middleware)
→ Live in 8 days

[Similar Company] just went live with 47,000 passports. Want to see how?

Subject: How [Competitor/Customer Name] automated EU DPP compliance in 8 days

Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How is [Company] planning to meet the EU Battery Regulation's Digital Product Passport requirement (Feb 18, 2027)?

THE CHALLENGE:
Every battery >2kWh sold in the EU needs a DPP with manufacturing data, carbon footprint, material composition, and recycling info. The penalty for non-compliance? €10M+ or 5% of global revenue.

THE SAP PROBLEM:
You already have the data (it's in SAP), but there's no "Create DPP" button. The data lives across 50+ tables in MM, PP, QM, and EHS modules. Most companies estimate 12-18 months to build custom extractions.

OUR SOLUTION:
PhotonicTag is a native SAP S/4HANA connector that auto-generates compliant DPPs in 8 days:
• $25K pilot → 5,000 SKUs, 3 months, 3 users
• 8-day implementation → SAP transport + field mapping + bulk generation
• No middleware → Direct ABAP integration (SAP-certified)

PROOF:
[Customer Name, e.g., "A European Tier-1 automotive supplier"] went live in 11 days and generated 47,000 passports. Their IT team estimated 14 months to build it in-house.

Worth a 15-minute technical deep-dive to see if it fits your timeline?

Use when: Highly engaged prospect (e.g., replied to earlier email, attended webinar)

Subject: [Company]'s path to EU DPP compliance — 8 days vs. 12 months

Hi [First Name],

I've been following [Company]'s expansion in the EU battery market (congrats on the [recent news, e.g., "new plant in Poland"]!). Given the Feb 18, 2027 EU Digital Product Passport deadline, I wanted to share how we're helping companies like [Similar Company] avoid the compliance crunch.

---

THE PROBLEM YOU'RE FACING

The EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) mandates DPPs for all batteries >2kWh. Without them, you can't sell in the EU. The penalty? €10M+ fines or 5% of annual revenue.

Here's the kicker: You already have 80% of the required data in SAP S/4HANA. It's just scattered across:
• Material Master (MARA, MARC)
• Bill of Materials (STPO, MAST)
• Batch records (MCH1)
• Quality certs (QALS)
• Carbon footprint (Sustainability module)

But there's no native SAP function to extract and format it for EU compliance.

---

THE 3 PATHS COMPANIES EXPLORE (All Risky)

1. Build in-house → 12-18 months, $800K-2M, risk of missing deadline
2. Wait for SAP's native module → Rumored for late 2026, timeline unconfirmed
3. Generic DPP tool → 6-9 months to build API middleware, doesn't speak SAP

Most companies we talk to started down Path #1 or #2, realized they'd miss the deadline, and came to us at the 11th hour.

---

HOW PHOTONICTAG WORKS

We built a native SAP S/4HANA connector specifically for EU DPP compliance:

• Day 1: Install SAP transport (2-hour BASIS admin task)
• Days 2-5: Field mapping (we pre-configure 90% of standard SAP tables)
• Day 6: Generate test passports (100 SKUs for QA)
• Days 7-8: Bulk generation (10,000+ SKUs/hour) + QR code assignment

Pricing:
• $25K pilot → 5,000 SKUs, 3 users, 3 months
• $80-120K/year → Unlimited SKUs, 10-25 users, multi-plant support

---

PROOF POINT

[Customer Name], a [Industry] company with 60,000 battery SKUs, went live in 11 days:
• Generated 47,000 passports in Week 1
• Integrated with existing SAP PP/QM workflows
• Their IT Director told us: "We estimated 14 months to build this in-house. PhotonicTag saved us $1.2M and 13 months."

I can connect you with their team for a reference call.

NEXT STEPS

If [Company] is serious about avoiding the Feb 2027 crunch, let's do a 30-minute technical deep-dive:
1. Review your SAP table structure
2. Map your specific DPP data requirements
3. Walk through a live demo (SAP → DPP in 60 seconds)

SECTION 5: FOLLOW-UP SEQUENCES
====================================================================================================

--- SEQUENCE 1: POST-LINKEDIN CONNECTION (NO REPLY) ---
Goal: Move from LinkedIn to email or call

TOUCH 1 (Day 0): LinkedIn message (Discovery Question variant from Section 2)

TOUCH 2 (Day 4): LinkedIn follow-up

[First Name] — following up on my note about EU DPP compliance. 

No worries if it's not a priority right now, but I'd hate for [Company] to hit the Feb 2027 deadline scramble we're seeing with other battery OEMs.

Quick 10-min call to share what we're seeing in the industry? No pitch, just intel.

[Calendar Link]

TOUCH 3 (Day 8): Email (SHORT version from Section 4)

TOUCH 4 (Day 15): "Break-up" email

Subject: Closing the loop — EU DPP compliance

[First Name],

I've reached out a few times about PhotonicTag's SAP connector for EU DPP compliance (Feb 2027 deadline).

I'm guessing one of three things:
1. You're already solving this in-house → great!
2. It's not a priority yet → fair enough.
3. My timing is off → let me know when to circle back.

If it's #3, just reply with "Q3 2026" (or whenever) and I'll follow up then.

If it's #1 or #2, I'll stop bugging you. 😊

Either way, good luck navigating the regulation!

Best,  
[Your Name]

P.S. — If you know someone at [Company] who *is* owning DPP compliance, happy to redirect.

--- SEQUENCE 2: POST-COLD EMAIL (NO REPLY) ---
Goal: Get a meeting or disqualify

TOUCH 1 (Day 0): Cold email (MEDIUM version from Section 4)

TOUCH 2 (Day 5): Value-add follow-up

Subject: Re: How [Competitor/Customer] automated EU DPP compliance

[First Name],

Following up on my email from [Day]. 

I know inboxes are chaos, so here's the TL;DR:

→ PhotonicTag = SAP connector for EU Digital Product Passports  
→ 8-day implementation (vs. 12 months in-house)  
→ $25K pilot (5,000 SKUs, 3 months)

Attaching a 2-min demo video so you can see it in action (no meeting required).

If it's relevant, here's my calendar: [Link]  
If not, no worries — happy to connect you with [Customer Name] for a peer reference instead.

Best,  
[Your Name]

TOUCH 3 (Day 12): Question-based re-engagement

Subject: Quick question — EU DPP compliance

[First Name],

Last one from me, I promise. 😊

Curious: Is [Company] planning to build EU DPP compliance in-house, or are you evaluating vendors?

We're seeing most battery OEMs go one of three ways:
1. Build in-house (12-18 months, $1-2M)
2. Wait for SAP's module (risky — timeline unclear)
3. Use a vendor like PhotonicTag (8 days, $25K)

Which path is [Company] leaning toward? Happy to share what we're seeing from [Similar Company] if helpful.

Best,  
[Your Name]

TOUCH 4 (Day 20): "Permission to close" email

Subject: Should I close your file?

[First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing EU DPP compliance isn't on [Company]'s radar yet (or you've got it handled).

Should I:
A) Close your file and stop following up?  
B) Check back in Q3 2026 (6 months before deadline)?  
C) Connect you with [Customer Name] for a peer reference call?

Just reply A, B, or C and I'll take it from there.

Best,  
[Your Name]

Hi [First Name],

Great speaking with you today! Here's a quick recap:

What we covered:
• PhotonicTag's SAP connector for EU DPP compliance
• [Company]'s timeline (Feb 2027 deadline = 377 days)
• Pilot scope: 5,000 SKUs, 3 users, 3 months

Next steps (per our conversation):
1. I'll send the pilot agreement (redlined for legal review) by EOD
2. You'll intro me to [SAP BASIS admin name] for technical scoping
3. We'll schedule a 30-min architecture review with your IT team (here's my calendar: [Link])

Attachments:
• Pilot Agreement Template (redlined)
• SAP Technical Specs (ABAP transport details, table mappings)
• ROI Calculator (PhotonicTag vs. in-house build)

Target pilot kickoff: [Date, e.g., "Week of March 15"]

Let me know if I missed anything!

Best,  
[Your Name]

TOUCH 2 (Day 5): Gentle nudge (if no reply)

Subject: Re: Next steps — pilot agreement

[First Name],

Just checking in — did you get a chance to review the pilot agreement?

Happy to hop on a quick call to walk through any questions (legal, technical, or otherwise).

Also, I've lined up [Customer Name]'s Head of Supply Chain for a reference call whenever you're ready.

Best,  
[Your Name]

TOUCH 3 (Day 10): Executive escalation offer

Subject: Looping in leadership — pilot approval

Hi [First Name],

I know pilot approvals can get stuck in procurement/legal limbo. 

If it's helpful, I can loop in our CEO [Name] to connect with [Company's exec, e.g., "your CPO or CIO"] to fast-track this.

We've seen other battery OEMs move from first call → pilot kickoff in 7-10 days when leadership is aligned.

Would that help? Let me know and I'll make the intro.

Best,  
[Your Name]
