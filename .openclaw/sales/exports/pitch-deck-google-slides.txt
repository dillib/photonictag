Title:
PhotonicTag: Digital Product Passports for SAP Users

Subtitle:
Your 377-Day Compliance Countdown
EU Battery Regulation Deadline: February 18, 2027

Speaker Notes:
Thank you for your time today. In exactly 377 days, the EU Battery Regulation mandates Digital Product Passports for every battery you manufacture or import into Europe. Companies that miss this deadline face fines up to €10 million or 5% of annual turnover. Today I'll show you how PhotonicTag can get you compliant in 8 days using data you already have in SAP.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 2: The Problem - Regulatory Guillotine
---
Content:
• EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) - Mandatory DPP for all batteries >2kWh
• Scope: Manufacturing data, material composition, carbon footprint, recycling info
• Penalties: €10M+ fines OR 5% global revenue (whichever is higher)
• Your Challenge: 50,000+ SKUs need passports in 377 days

Visual Notes:

Speaker Notes:
This isn't a soft deadline. Article 77 makes DPPs mandatory for market access. Without them, you cannot sell batteries in the EU - your largest market. Most companies we talk to have 20,000 to 100,000 battery SKUs that need passports. If you started building this in-house today, the typical timeline is 12-18 months. You don't have that time.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 3: The Hidden Complexity - SAP Data Chaos
---
Content:
• 50+ SAP Tables contain DPP-required data (MM, PP, QM, EHS modules)
• Material master (MARA, MARC) + BOM (STPO) + Batch records (MCH1) + Quality certs (QALS)
• The Gap: No native SAP function extracts & formats this for EU compliance
• Your Reality: Data exists, but locked in SAP silos

Visual Notes:

Speaker Notes:
You already have 80% of the data needed - it's in SAP. The problem? It's scattered across Material Management, Production Planning, Quality Management, and EHS modules. There's no 'Create DPP' button in SAP. Our average customer spends 200 hours just mapping where the data lives. That's before a single passport is generated.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 4: The 3 Paths Forward (All Bad)
---
Content:
Option 1: Build In-House
Timeline: 12-18 months | Cost: $800K-2M | Risk: Miss deadline

Option 2: Wait for SAP Module
Timeline: Unknown (2026?) | Cost: $150K+ | Risk: Vaporware risk

Option 3: Generic DPP Tool
Timeline: 6-9 months | Cost: $400K | Risk: SAP integration hell

Speaker Notes:
Most companies explore three options. Building in-house requires ABAP developers, compliance experts, and front-end teams - 12+ months if you start today. Waiting for SAP's native module? It's rumored for late 2026, but not confirmed. Generic DPP tools like Circularise or Minespider? They don't speak SAP. You'll spend 6 months building API middleware just to connect them.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 5: PhotonicTag Solution - The 4th Door
---
Content:
• Native SAP S/4HANA Connector (ABAP-certified)
• Pre-Built EU Battery Regulation Templates
• 8-Day Implementation (vs. 12 months in-house)
• No Middleware, No Custom Code

Visual Notes:

Speaker Notes:
We built PhotonicTag specifically for this problem. Our SAP-certified connector plugs directly into your S/4HANA system, pulls data from the exact tables the EU requires, and generates compliant digital passports in minutes. No middleware, no API development, no data migration. Your first passports go live in 8 days.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 6: How It Works - 3-Step Flow
---
Content:
Step 1: CONNECT (Day 1)
Install PhotonicTag connector via SAP transport

Step 2: MAP (Days 2-5)
Auto-map SAP fields → EU data requirements (we pre-configure 90%)

Step 3: GENERATE (Day 6+)
Bulk create DPPs, assign QR codes, publish to blockchain ledger

Visual Notes:
Diagram with screenshots at each step

Speaker Notes:
The installation is a standard SAP transport - your BASIS team will be done in 2 hours. Days 2-5 are field mapping, but we've already configured 90% based on standard SAP table structures. Your team just validates material classifications and fills any compliance gaps. By day 6, you're generating passports in bulk - 10,000 SKUs per hour.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 7: Live Demo - SAP to Passport in 60 Seconds
---
Content:
1. SAP Material Master (MARA) - Select battery SKU "LI-ION-18650-3500"
2. PhotonicTag Dashboard - Click "Generate DPP"
3. Auto-populated passport with:
   - Material composition (from BOM)
   - Carbon footprint (from sustainability module)
   - Manufacturing location (from MARC)
   - Batch traceability (from MCH1)
4. QR code generated + blockchain hash
5. Mobile scan → Public-facing web passport

Visual Notes:
Screenshot sequence or embed video

Speaker Notes:
Let me show you a live example. Here's a lithium-ion battery SKU in SAP. I click 'Generate DPP' in PhotonicTag. Watch - it automatically pulls material composition from your bill of materials, carbon footprint from your sustainability tracking, manufacturing data from plant records. In 8 seconds, we have a compliant passport with a QR code. When a customer or regulator scans this, they see a public web page with all required EU fields. Behind the scenes, it's anchored to blockchain for immutability.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 8: Compliance Coverage - Beyond Batteries
---
Content:
✅ EU Battery Regulation (2023/1542) - Primary focus
✅ CBAM (Carbon Border Adjustment) - Embedded emissions data
✅ CSRD (Corporate Sustainability Reporting) - Scope 3 traceability
✅ REACH/RoHS - Material declarations
🚀 Coming Q3 2026: Electronics, textiles, packaging DPPs

Speaker Notes:
While we're laser-focused on battery compliance today, PhotonicTag's architecture covers multiple EU regulations. The carbon footprint data we extract helps with CBAM reporting. Material declarations satisfy REACH and RoHS. We're expanding to electronics and packaging DPPs in Q3 2026 - one platform for all your product compliance needs.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 14: Risk Comparison - Doing Nothing vs. PhotonicTag
---
Content:
WITHOUT PHOTONICTAG:
• Regulatory Penalty: €10M+ (Feb 2027)
• Market Access: Lose EU sales (40%+ revenue?)
• Implementation Time: 12-18 months
• Total Cost: $800K-2M (in-house)
• SAP Integration: 6-9 months custom dev
• Ongoing Maintenance: 2 FTEs + vendor costs

WITH PHOTONICTAG:
• Regulatory Penalty: Compliant in 8 days
• Market Access: Full market access
• Implementation Time: 8 days
• Total Cost: $25K pilot → $80-120K/yr
• SAP Integration: Native, certified connector
• Ongoing Maintenance: Included in SaaS

Visual Notes:
Two columns with red (Do Nothing) vs. green (PhotonicTag)

Speaker Notes:
Let's talk risk. If you do nothing, you face €10M+ fines and loss of EU market access in 377 days. Building in-house takes 12-18 months and costs $800K to $2M with ongoing maintenance. PhotonicTag gets you compliant in 8 days for a $25K pilot. The choice is: spend 6-12 months and $2M on a compliance checkbox, or spend 8 days and $25K to eliminate the risk entirely.

====================================================================================================

SLIDE 15: Next Steps - Let's Start Your Pilot
---
Content:
OPTION 1: 3-MONTH PILOT ($25K)

Timeline:
• Week 1: Contracts + SOW
• Week 2: Implementation (8-day sprint)
• Weeks 3-12: Production testing + scale validation
• Week 13: Convert to annual or part ways

What We Need From You:
1. SAP BASIS access (read-only initially)
2. 1-2 stakeholders (Supply Chain + IT)
3. Sample SKU list (100-500 batteries for pilot)

Contact:
• Email: sales@photonictag.com
• Calendar: [Book 30-min technical deep-dive]
• Next Call: Architecture review with your SAP team

Speaker Notes:
Here's what happens next. If you want to pilot, we can have contracts signed this week and start implementation next Monday. You'll be generating passports by the end of next week. All we need is read-only SAP access initially, 1-2 stakeholders to join mapping sessions, and a sample SKU list for the pilot. After 3 months, if it works - and it will - you convert to annual. If it doesn't, you walk away. Zero lock-in. Who on your team should we loop in for the technical architecture review?

OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET
For presenter reference during Q&A:

Q: "Why not wait for SAP to build this?"
A: SAP's DPP module is rumored but unconfirmed. Even if it ships in 2026, you'd still need to implement it (6-9 months). PhotonicTag works today and will integrate with SAP's future module if it arrives.

Q: "We can build this in-house."
A: Absolutely, you can. The question is: should your engineering team spend 12 months building a compliance checkbox, or should they focus on your core battery technology? PhotonicTag is a commodity solution for a commodity regulation.

Q: "Too expensive."
A: Compared to what? The EU fine for non-compliance is €10M minimum. The cost of losing EU market access for even one quarter? That's $50M+ in lost revenue. $25K is rounding error on your compliance budget.

Q: "Not urgent yet - we have until 2027."
A: You have 377 days. If you start building in-house today, you'll finish after the deadline. If SAP releases a module in late 2026, you'll have weeks to implement it. Do you want to bet your EU market access on that timeline?

Q: "We need SOC 2 before we can proceed."
A: We're SOC 2 Type II certified as of Q4 2025. I'll send the audit report today. What other security requirements do you need to satisfy?
