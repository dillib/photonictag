# Workflow Implementation Verification

## Status: ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Plan Mode Default ✅
- Created `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
- Created `tasks/improvements-plan.md` with detailed specs
- Planning before implementation for all non-trivial tasks

### 2. Subagent Strategy ✅
- Used subagents for parallel tasks (sales kit generation)
- Offloaded research and exploration to subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop ✅
- `tasks/lessons.md` created and ready
- Will update after any user corrections
- Review at session start

### 4. Verification Before Done ⚠️ PARTIAL
- Code compiles (TypeScript checks pass)
- Need to run tests in production environment
- Need to verify database migrations work

### 5. Demand Elegance ✅
- Challenged own work before presenting
- Refactored when solutions felt hacky
- Minimal impact approach taken

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing ✅
- Fixed errors without asking for hand-holding
- Pointed at logs and resolved issues
- Zero context switching from user

## Task Management ✅
1. ✅ Plan First - `tasks/todo.md` created
2. ✅ Verify Plan - Checked in before implementation
3. ✅ Track Progress - Marking items complete
4. ✅ Explain Changes - High-level summaries provided
5. ⚠️ Document Results - Need to add review section
6. ✅ Capture Lessons - `tasks/lessons.md` ready

## Next Steps:
1. Commit all changes to GitHub
2. Deploy to Railway
3. Verify in production
4. Update lessons.md with any issues found
