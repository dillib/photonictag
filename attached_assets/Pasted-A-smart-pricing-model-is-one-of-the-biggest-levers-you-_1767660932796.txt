A smart pricing model is one of the biggest levers you have for turning Photonictag into a category‑defining platform. Because your product spans **compliance**, **traceability**, **identity**, and **AI**, you can price it like a *mission‑critical infrastructure layer*, not a simple SaaS tool.

Here’s the model I recommend — and why it works.

---

# 🌟 **The Ideal Pricing Model for Photonictag**
A **hybrid usage‑based + platform subscription** model.  
This aligns perfectly with how manufacturers, brands, and marketplaces think about cost:  
**pay for the volume of products**, not seats.

Below is the structure I’d use.

---

# 1️⃣ **Platform Subscription (Base Fee)**
This gives you predictable recurring revenue.

### **Tiers**
- **Starter** – $99/mo  
- **Growth** – $499/mo  
- **Enterprise** – $2,000+/mo  

### **What’s included**
- Admin dashboard  
- API access  
- Basic analytics  
- 1–3 team members  
- Limited AI usage  
- Limited product identities  

This fee covers your infrastructure and ensures customers are committed.

---

# 2️⃣ **Per‑Product Identity Fee (Your Core Revenue Driver)**
Every product gets a **Digital Product Passport + QR identity**.  
This is where your revenue scales with the customer’s business.

### Suggested pricing:
- **$0.02 – $0.10 per product** for high‑volume manufacturers  
- **$0.25 – $1.00 per product** for low‑volume, high‑value goods (luxury, electronics)  

This aligns with:
- serialization  
- QR generation  
- DPP storage  
- lifecycle tracking  

Manufacturers *expect* to pay per item — it fits their mental model.

---

# 3️⃣ **AI Intelligence Add‑On (High‑Margin Upsell)**
This is your differentiator.  
Price it separately to maximize margin.

### AI Add‑On Pricing
- **$99/mo** for small brands  
- **$499/mo** for mid‑market  
- **$2,000+/mo** for enterprise  

### Includes:
- AI sustainability scoring  
- AI repair summaries  
- AI circularity recommendations  
- AI anomaly detection (counterfeit risk)  

This becomes a major upsell because it replaces manual compliance work.

---

# 4️⃣ **Traceability Events (Usage‑Based)**
Every supply‑chain event (manufactured, shipped, received, recycled) can be priced.

### Suggested:
- **$0.001 – $0.01 per event**  
- Volume discounts for >10M events  

This is similar to how AWS, Stripe, and IoT platforms price usage.

---

# 5️⃣ **Authentication Scans (Optional Revenue Stream)**
For luxury goods, electronics, and resale markets.

### Suggested:
- **$0.05 – $0.25 per scan**  
- Or bundle: **10,000 scans for $500**  

This is extremely profitable because the cost is near zero.

---

# 6️⃣ **Enterprise Licensing**
For large manufacturers, marketplaces, or governments.

### Pricing:
- **$50k – $500k per year**  
- Custom SLAs  
- On‑prem or VPC deployment  
- Dedicated support  
- Custom integrations  

This is where your biggest deals will come from.

# 🧠 **Putting It All Together (Example)**

### A mid‑size electronics brand:
- 1M products/year → $0.05 each = **$50,000**  
- Platform subscription = **$499/mo = $6,000**  
- AI add‑on = **$499/mo = $6,000**  
- Traceability events = **$10,000**  

**Total annual revenue from one customer: ~$72,000**

### A large enterprise:
- 10M products/year → $0.03 each = **$300,000**  
- Enterprise license = **$150,000**  
- AI add‑on = **$24,000**  
- Traceability events = **$50,000**  

**Total annual revenue: ~$524,000**

This is how Photonictag becomes a $100M+ ARR business.
