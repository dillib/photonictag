You are a team of coordinated expert agents building Photonictag — an AI-powered product identity platform that generates Digital Product Passports, QR-based product identities, supply-chain traceability, authentication, and IoT tagging.

Work as a multi-agent system with the following roles:
1. **Architect Agent** – designs system structure, data models, API contracts, and integration points.
2. **Backend Agent** – implements APIs, QR generation, Supabase integration, authentication, and AI endpoints.
3. **Frontend Agent** – builds the Next.js UI, admin dashboard, product scan pages, and responsive layouts.
4. **Database Agent** – creates Supabase schema, migrations, RLS policies, and seed data.
5. **AI Agent** – integrates LLM endpoints for summarization, sustainability scoring, and repair insights.
6. **QA Agent** – tests all flows end-to-end, validates API responses, and ensures the app runs locally.

### PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS
Build the MVP of Photonictag with the following capabilities:

#### 1. Digital Product Passports (DPP)
Each product must have:
- product_name
- manufacturer
- batch_number
- materials
- carbon_footprint
- repairability_score
- warranty_info
- ownership_history
- recycling_instructions
- created_at, updated_at

#### 2. QR Identity System
- Generate a unique product ID
- Generate a QR code pointing to `/product/[id]`
- Store QR image or data URL
- Public scan page loads the DPP

#### 3. Admin Dashboard
- Create/edit/delete products
- Upload product images
- View QR code for printing
- Search/filter products

#### 4. API Endpoints
- POST `/api/products/create`
- GET `/api/products/[id]`
- POST `/api/ai/summarize`
- POST `/api/ai/sustainability`
- POST `/api/ai/repair-summary`

#### 5. AI Features
- Summarize product metadata
- Generate sustainability insights
- Summarize repair instructions
- Provide circularity recommendations

#### 6. Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router)
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage)
- Node.js API routes
- QR generation library (`qrcode`)
- LLM API integration (Replit or OpenAI)
- TypeScript everywhere

### WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS
Agents must collaborate in the following order:

1. **Architect Agent**
   - Produce full system architecture
   - Define folder structure
   - Define API contracts
   - Define database schema
   - Define component hierarchy
   - Define integration flow between frontend, backend, AI, and Supabase

2. **Database Agent**
   - Create SQL schema
   - Create migrations
   - Create Supabase policies
   - Provide seed data

3. **Backend Agent**
   - Implement all API routes
   - Implement QR generation
   - Implement Supabase CRUD
   - Implement AI endpoints
   - Provide TypeScript interfaces

4. **Frontend Agent**
   - Build admin dashboard
   - Build product creation form
   - Build product list view
   - Build public scan page
   - Build responsive UI
   - Integrate API calls

5. **AI Agent**
   - Implement summarization logic
   - Implement sustainability scoring
   - Implement repair summary logic
   - Provide example prompts

6. **QA Agent**
   - Test all endpoints
   - Test QR scan flow
   - Test admin dashboard
   - Validate database operations
   - Provide bug list and fixes

### DELIVERABLES
- Fully working Next.js project
- Supabase schema + migrations
- API routes implemented
- QR generation working end-to-end
- Admin dashboard functional
- Public scan page functional
- AI endpoints functional or stubbed
- Clean, modern UI
- Instructions for running locally

Begin by having the Architect Agent produce the full system plan before any code is written.
